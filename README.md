<H1>Netflix Movies and TV shows using ML</H1>
<p>This project, completed as part of an internship at K.R. Mangalam University, explores patterns in Netflix content to understand user preferences and content trends. Using a dataset of Netflix titles, I applied data preprocessing, machine learning algorithms, and data visualization to extract insights and make predictive models. The goal is to support data-driven content strategies and enhance user experience on streaming platforms.</p>

<h2>Project Objectives</h2>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Develop Predictive Models:</strong> Predict show ratings and viewer engagement based on attributes like genre, director, and country.</li>
    <li><strong>Identify Trends:</strong> Analyze release patterns and popular genres to reveal trends in viewer preferences.</li>
    <li><strong>Visualize Insights:</strong> Create visualizations to present findings and support content curation strategies.</li>
    <li><strong>Skill Development:</strong> Improve proficiency in Python, data analysis, and machine learning.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Methodologies</h2>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Data Preprocessing:</strong> Cleaning and normalizing data, handling missing values, and ensuring dataset consistency.</li>
    <li><strong>Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):</strong> Using Python libraries (Pandas, Matplotlib) to visualize and explore data.</li>
    <li><strong>Model Development:</strong> Applying regression and classification algorithms to predict outcomes and analyze viewer trends.</li>
    <li><strong>Data Visualization:</strong> Generating interactive dashboards and visualizations for easy interpretation.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Key Outcomes</h2>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Predictive Models:</strong> Developed models for estimating show popularity with accuracy metrics, including linear regression, logistic regression, decision trees, and random forests.</li>
    <li><strong>Viewer Insights:</strong> Identified influential factors in viewer engagement, such as genre and release year.</li>
    <li><strong>Actionable Visualizations:</strong> Created dashboards to help stakeholders understand content trends.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Tools and Technologies</h2>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Languages:</strong> Python</li>
    <li><strong>Libraries:</strong> Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-Learn, Matplotlib, Seaborn</li>
    <li><strong>Algorithms:</strong> Linear regression, logistic regression, decision trees, random forests</li>
</ul>
