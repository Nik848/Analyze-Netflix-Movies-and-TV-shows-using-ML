<H1>Netflix Movies and TV shows using ML</H1>
<p>This project, completed as part of an internship at K.R. Mangalam University, explores patterns in Netflix content to understand user preferences and content trends. Using a dataset of Netflix titles, I applied data preprocessing, machine learning algorithms, and data visualization to extract insights and make predictive models. The goal is to support data-driven content strategies and enhance user experience on streaming platforms.</p>

<h3>Project Objectives</h3>
